- Replace blocking 100M iteration loop with Web Worker implementation
- Add chunked processing alternative to yield control to main thread
- Include mathematical optimization using sum formula
- Reduces TBT from 600ms to ~0ms, improving Lighthouse performance score

Fixes performance bottleneck that was blocking main thread for 600ms during component initialization.
